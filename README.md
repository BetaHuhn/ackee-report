</div>

## üëã Introduction

[ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) lets you create monthly website performance reports using your [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/ackee) analytics data and deliver them to multiple recipients via email. It uses [Ackee's](https://github.com/electerious/ackee) Graphql API and can be configured to send multiple reports for different websites and recipients.

## üöÄ Get started

Install [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) via npm:
```shell
npm install ackee-report
```

On the first run [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) will ask you to input a few values:

- *Ackee server* - The endpoint of your Ackee instance
- *Ackee username* - Your Ackee username you use to login to the UI
- *Ackee password* - Your Ackee password you use to login to the UI
- *SMTP host* - SMTP host (more info [here](#configuration))
- *SMTP port* - SMTP port (more info [here](#configuration))
- *SMTP username* - more info [here](#configuration)
- *SMTP password* - more info [here](#configuration)
- *SMTP from* - more info [here](#configuration)

The configuration will be stored in your home directory: `~/.config/configstore/ackee-report.json`

## üìö Usage

```shell
Usage: ackee-report generate [options]

Generates report and sends it via specified service

Options:
  -d, --domain <titles...>  specify domains by title
  -i, --id <ids...>         specify domains by id
  -t, --to <recipient...>   to whom the report should be sent (when using email)
  -o, --output <file>       path to output file (when using json)
  -s, --service <name>      service to use (default: "email")
  -h, --help                display help for command
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Examples

Running

```shell
ackee-report generate -d example.com -t hello@example.com
```

will generate a report for the domain `example.com` and send it via email to `hello@example.com`.

To do this every month, create a cron job:

```shell
0 0 1 * * ackee-report generate -d example.com -t hello@example.com >> /tmp/ackee-report.log 2>&1
```

You can also specify mulitple domains and recipients:

```shell
ackee-report generate -d example.com example2.com -t hello@example.com hey@example2.com
```

To send multiple reports to different people, add them all as seperate cron jobs.

You can also save the report in a JSON file instead of sending it via email:

```shell
ackee-report generate -s json -d example.com -o report.json
```
