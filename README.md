## üëã Introduction

[ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) lets you create monthly website performance reports using your [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/ackee) analytics data and either send them via email, generate a RSS feed or output it to a JSON file. It uses [Ackee's](https://github.com/electerious/ackee) Graphql API and can be configured to generate multiple reports for different websites, data ranges and recipients.

## üöÄ Get started

Install [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) globally via npm:
```shell
npm install ackee-report -g
```

After that `ackee-report` is ready to be used üéâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

On the first run [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) will ask you to input a few values:

- *ackee server* / `ACKEE_SERVER` - the endpoint of your Ackee instance
- *ackee token* / `ACKEE_TOKEN` - a permanent Ackee token (can be used instead of username and password, [more info](#ackee-api-authentication))
- *ackee username* `ACKEE_USERNAME` - your Ackee username ([more info](#ackee-api-authentication))
- *ackee password* `ACKEE_PASSWORD` - your Ackee password ([more info](#ackee-api-authentication))
- *email host* / `EMAIL_HOST` - the domain of the email server ([more info](#email-setup))
- *email port* / `EMAIL_PORT` - the port of the email server ([more info](#email-setup))
- *email username* / `EMAIL_USERNAME` - the username to use with the email server ([more info](#email-setup))
- *email password* / `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - the password to use with the email server ([more info](#email-setup))
- *email from* / `EMAIL_FROM` - the from address to use ([more info](#email-setup))

The configuration will be stored in your home directory under `~/.config/configstore/ackee-report.json` and can be changed at any point.

### Environment Variables

If you don't want to interact with [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) via the CLI interface, you can also specify each configuration option as an environment variable e.g. `ACKEE_TOKEN=<token>`

### Ackee API authentication

[ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) needs access to your Ackee instance via the API in order to get all the data it needs to generate the report. You can choose any of the two authentication methods below:

**Username and password:**

Enter your username and password you use to login to the Ackee UI on the first run of [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) or change it in the config file later.

[ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) will then use them to create a temporary access token each time it runs and use it to query the Ackee API.

**Permanent access token (recommended):**

The recommended way of authenticating [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) is with a permanent access token (only available with Ackee [v2.2.0](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee/releases/tag/v2.2.0) or later). 

You will have to create one via the Ackee UI under `Settings`/`Permanent Tokens`, then click on `New permanent token` and give it a name (doesn't matter what).

Copy the `permanent token id` and enter it on the first run of [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) or add it to the config file under `ackee.token` later.

The same token will then be used each time [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report) runs to query the Ackee API.

### Email setup

If you want to send your report via email, you have to specify your email providers SMTP server and credentials, as well as the from option:

- *Host* - `smtp.example.com`
- *Port* - `465`
- *Username* - `username@example.com`
- *Password* - `password`
- *From* - `username@example.com` or `Ackee <username@example.com>`

> **Note:** For port 465 ackee-report will use TLS when connecting to your email server, on all other ports it will use STARTTLS (#44)

Common providers:

<details><summary>Gmail</summary>

If you use gmail to send emails, use these values:

- *Host* - `smtp.gmail.com`
- *Port* - `465`
- *Username* -  your gmail username (your email address)

## üìö Usage

```shell
Usage: ackee-report <command> [options]

CLI tool to generate performance reports of websites using the self-hosted analytics tool Ackee.

Commands:
  email [options]             Generate report and send it via email
  json [options]              Query API for data and output it to JSON file
  html [options]              Generate report and output it to a HTML file
  rss|xml [options]           Generate report as a RSS feed
  domains|domain [titles...]  get domain id by title
  config                      output current config
  help [command]              display help for command

Options:
  General:
    -d, --domain <titles...>    specify domains by title
    -i, --id <ids...>           specify domains by id
    -r, --range <range>         specify data range (default: "month")
    -l, --limit <number>        limit number of list items (default: 3)
    -e, --events [type]         get event data (default: false)
    -v, --version               output the version number
    -h, --help                  display help for command

  Email:
    -t, --to <recipient...>     to whom the report should be sent

  RSS/JSON/HTML:
    -o, --output <file>         path to output file (default: "report.[xml/json/html]")

Example call:
  $ ackee-report email --domain example.com --to hello@example.com
```

If you want to send the report periodically, you have to setup a cron job which runs the command at a set interval (example below).

## üõ†Ô∏è Examples

### Generate a report for one domain and send it via email

```shell
ackee-report email -d example.com -t hello@example.com
```

This will generate a report for the domain `example.com` and send it via email to `hello@example.com`.

### Multiple domains and recipients

```shell
ackee-report email -d example.com example2.com -t hello@example.com hey@example2.com
```

### Include events in report

```shell
ackee-report email -d all -t hello@example.com -e
```

### Average event type

```shell
ackee-report email -d all -t hello@example.com -e avg
```

### Custom range

You can specify the data range of the report with the `-r`/`--range` option:

```shell
ackee-report email -d example.com -t hello@example.com -r day
```

Available values: `day`/`week`/`month`/`six_months`.

**Note:** The `total views/range` value is calculated by counting the views of the last x days since the program ran. For the `month` range for example, it is not the number of views in the current month, but the number of views in the last 30 days.

### Send the report periodically (cron)

To send a report periodically, for example every month at the 28th at 23:55 setup a cron job like this:

```shell
55 23 28 * * ackee-report email -d example.com -t hello@example.com >> /tmp/ackee-report.log 2>&1
```

**Note:** We use the 28th as running on the last day of the month is very complicated with cron and Ackee resets its data on the first day of each month.

**Note:** You may have to specify the actual path to ackee-report. In that case, replace `ackee-report` in the command above with the output of `which ackee-report`.

If you are not familiar with cron, [here's](https://ostechnix.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cron-jobs/) a tutorial on how to get started.

To send multiple reports to different people, add them all as seperate cron jobs.

### Generate RSS feed

You can generate a RSS feed/xml file instead of sending the report via email:

```shell
ackee-report rss -d example.com -o output.xml
```

### Output the report to a JSON file

You can also save the report in a JSON file:

```shell
ackee-report json -d example.com -o output.json
```

### Output the email report to a HTML file

You can also save the report, which is normally sent via email, directly to an HTML file:

```shell
ackee-report html -d example.com -o index.html
```
